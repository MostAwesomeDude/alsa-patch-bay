  ALSA Patch Bay
 ================

This is a GUI patchbay for the the ALSA seq sequencer api and the JACK audio
API.  It can use FLTK 1.1 or GTKmm 2.0.0.  If you have both installed, you
can specify which to use with the --ui command line option.  The --driver
command line option selects the driver.  Alternatively, there should be a
jack-patch-bay link installed which points to the alsa-patch-bay binary and
will automatically load the jack driver.

Patches to node@users.sourceforge.net.  Future versions at
